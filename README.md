# vim

# installation (works for fedora and ubuntu)
Run python3 install.py, and choose one variant of installation:
   1) 1 - just updates .vimrc
   2) 2 - main idea to install only shorcuts without GUI, but i forgot to add extra config for this
   3) 3 - full setup, pylint will work after you logout
